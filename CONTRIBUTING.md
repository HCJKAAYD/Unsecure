## Request Support

If you have a question about this project, how to use it, or just need clarification about something:

* Open an Issue at https://github.com/HCJKAAYD/Unsecure/issues
* Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.

Once it's filed:

## Report an Error or Bug

If you run into an error or bug with the project:

* Open an Issue at https://github.com/HCJKAAYD/Unsecure/issues
* Include *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the bug or error on their own.

Once it's filed:

* A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no repro steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.

## Request a Feature

If the project doesn't do something you need or want it to do:

* Open an Issue at https://github.com/HCJKAAYD/Unsecure/issues
* Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
* Please try and be clear about why existing features and alternatives would not work for you.

Once it's filed:

* The project team will evaluate the feature request, possibly asking you more questions to understand its purpose and any relevant requirements. If the issue is closed, the team will convey their reasoning and suggest an alternative path forward.

Note: The team is unlikely to be able to accept every single feature request that is filed. Please understand if they need to say no.
